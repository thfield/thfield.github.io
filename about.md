I'm a former Aerospace Engineer reinventing myself as a web developer.  I'm interested in data visualizations, enabling better decisions, and working on projects that have a day-to-day impact on users.

Some of the technologies I'm familar with:

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* D3.js
* jQuery
* Ruby on Rails
* SQL
* Django
